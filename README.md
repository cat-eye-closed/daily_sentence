# daily_sentence

This  is a program which can recommend sentences everyday.

The functions realized:

* part of the UI
* change sentence randomly with a button
* a button drawn by myself which can change when clicked.
* you can click the heart_shaped button to favorite the sentence you love and it will be stored in your favorite file.
* you can enter a word to search for the sentences including it.
* the text part will have a random colorful halo tracking the mouse.
* you can listen some musics when using it.(you can also add mp3 into the file resources/musics to listen your own)

Just being developed. No releases at present.

Thank you for your expectation.
